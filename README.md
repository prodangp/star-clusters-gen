# Generating synthetic star clusters using Gaussian processes

The project is still in progress

### Current Features 
<ul>
    <li>Generates synthetic star clusters with customizable size and density distributions
    <li>Supports Gaussian process regression for generating new density maps from observed data
    <li>Offers both MCMC and rejection sampling methods for generating random samples from the density map
</ul>
